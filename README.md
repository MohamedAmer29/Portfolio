# üåê Personal Portfolio ‚Äì Built with Vue.js & Vite

This project is my personal developer portfolio website, designed and developed using **Vue.js** along with the fast and efficient **Vite** build tool. It serves as a professional digital presence where I showcase my skills, experience, and the projects I‚Äôve worked on. The goal of this portfolio is not only to highlight my technical abilities but also to reflect my eye for design, responsiveness, and user-centric interaction.

The landing page introduces visitors to who I am, featuring a clean hero section with my name, role, and a short tagline or mission. From there, users can scroll or navigate through other key sections:  **About Me** ,  **Skills** ,  **Projects** , and  **Contact** . Each section is carefully structured to be both informative and visually engaging.

* **About Me:** A short narrative about my background, interests in technology, and current focus. It gives visitors insight into my personality and motivations as a developer.
* **Skills:** A grid-based visual display of the tools and technologies I‚Äôm proficient with, such as Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, and more. Icons and styling help communicate these quickly and clearly.
* **Projects:** One of the most important sections, this area highlights select projects I've built or contributed to. Each project entry includes a title, description, tech stack used, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories. The layout is responsive and includes hover effects or animations to improve interactivity.
* **Contact:** A simple yet functional contact form that allows potential collaborators or employers to reach out to me. It typically includes validation and possibly integration with a service like Formspree or EmailJS to handle submissions.

From a technical standpoint, the site is built with component-based architecture, using Vue‚Äôs reactive features and modern CSS techniques (like Flexbox, Grid, and transitions) to ensure smooth user experience across all devices. Animations and scroll-based effects bring a sense of liveliness without overwhelming the content.

Performance optimization is a key consideration, and Vite makes the development experience fast and enjoyable while also providing optimized production builds. The site is fully responsive and has been tested on multiple screen sizes to ensure accessibility and usability.

This portfolio not only demonstrates my technical stack but also represents my approach to development‚Äîclean code, attention to detail, and an appreciation for both function and aesthetics. It‚Äôs more than just a website; it‚Äôs a personal brand hub, resume, and project showcase all in one.

Whether you're a recruiter, potential collaborator, or just a curious visitor, I hope this site gives you a good impression of who I am and what I can do.
